Today was the Apple Event we've all been waiting for, where Apple finally pulled back the curtain and revealed the iPhone 15 to the public along with much more. Will it live up to the rumours that have been going around for months, let's find out!

## iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro
The new iPhone 15 and 15 Pro models have just been announced and look great as ever. As expected, the iPhone 15 will adopt USB-C (finally) and have Dynamic Island, even on the base tier.

This year, the iPhone 15 comes with a 48MP main camera with 2x Telephoto and improved focus. Photos will also now be able to switch to Portrait mode after being captured, and the focus will be able to be shifter after the fact.

iPhone 15 will also come with Satellite SOS All these new features look pretty cool, and there is quite a bit of new features, it builds on the iPhone 14's strong points and really does look like a genuine improvement and I can see it being useful in the hands of consumers.

## Apple Watch Series 9
Apple's Watch 9 looks pretty similar to Series 8 at first glance, but there is one massive feature which deserves recognition. Double Tap allows you to control your Apple Watch without even reaching for the screen, you can control music, timers, calls and much more just by tapping your fingers together. This looks like a really great feature, especially for users with only one arm.

Apple also showed us the Apple Watch Ultra 2, which looks largely similar to last year's Apple Watch Ultra, just building on it with strength, performance and software changes. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 will also get the Double Tap gesture. 

## AirPods
There were no new AirPods teased this year, just a brand new USB-C case for the AirPods Pro Gen 2, this looks promising however I am unhappy having just purchased a pair of AirPods Pro gen 2 that they may expect me to purchase a whole new pair of AirPods just for the new case, we'll see how this pans out, and I'll ask next time I'm in an Apple Store, so stay updated on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/connorjrt) for that.

## Conclusion
Wow! This was an event packed full of amazing new features, what did you think, will you be pre-ordering your iPhone 15 on September 15? Feel free to comment or tweet me @ConnorJrt. What did you think about the launch this year, and was there anything you expected that they missed out? Let me know!

Finally, I'd like to address that I haven't posted in over a month - I've been taking a break from writing weekly, and it's pretty good, not sure if things will return to the same frequency as before, but I don't plan on completely stopping anytime soon.
