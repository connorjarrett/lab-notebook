I was never keen on Elon Musk buying Twitter, and I expected some pretty stupid changes when he did, but never for the platform to entirely rebrand.

## The "everything app"
Elon Musk expressed interest in a social media app more than Twitter, a home for videos, photos, text and more. Actually, something like this already exists, "WeChat" is a Chinese messaging, social media and mobile payment app developed by Tencent. 

## ùïè
Twitter has since be rebranded to "X". Tweets have been renamed to "Posts", which I think kills all the individuality about Twitter - You can read a "Post" anywhere, but "Tweets" tell you where and what.

However, as demonstrated by the picture above, the rebranding to X is slow, to the point where even on [about.twitter.com](about.twitter.com), the only thing that changed is the logo, not the domain or even name.

## The logo
The logo sparked some small controversy when it was announced, but before that people were even designing logos for Musk for free.

The logo we got is depressingly basic, it says nothing about the platform or what it does, and has completely dropped the old iconic bird.

While it has since been taken down, the X sign on the roof of the office in San Francisco would pulse and strobe, even throughout the night. [You can see a video of that here](https://twitter.com/realchrisjbeale/status/1685399749166551040?s=20)

## Conclusion
Personally, I don't think X is here to stay, it feels like the sort of thing that would be reverted either after a while, or after Twitter comes under new management. I don't like the change and I think it's sad they've sucked the life out of the platform, but I'm willing to see where it goes.
